  %p 
    Look for materials that are up to date and use current best practices 
    (probably written in 2010 or 2011).
  %p 
    Be wary of tutorial materials that fail to use Ruby 1.9+ and Rails 3.0+, 
    or fail to reference Git, RVM, or Bundler.

      We've found this book to be an excellent resource for top-down learners:

      the language and framework function as they go.
